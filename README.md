## 📦 Supply Chain Cost Optimization Dashboard – Power BI

### 📌 Overview

This Power BI project provides a **cost-driven decision analysis** for a manufacturing supply chain using a **"Make vs Buy" strategy**. The analysis compares **non-recurring expenses**, **unit costs**, and **full cost scenarios** across various suppliers and in-house manufacturing capacities to support strategic sourcing decisions.
